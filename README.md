# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## Data Cleaning & Processing

The first step of the model is data visualisation and analysis with *pandas*. To predict survivability, the following features from the Kaggle dataset were used:


## Deep Neural Network (DNN) solution

__Hyperparameter-tuned DNN with AdamW optimiser (with weight decay regularisation) and holdout cross-validation.__



## Random Forest Classifer (RF) solution
