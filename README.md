# Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster

## Data Cleaning & Processing

The first step of the model is data visualisation and analysis with *pandas*. To predict survivability, the following features from the Kaggle dataset were used:


## Deep Neural Network (DNN) solution

__Hyperparameter-tuned DNN with AdamW optimiser (with weight decay regularisation) and holdout validation.__
α = 0.00014341, λ = 0.009, layer_dims = [6, 15, 10, 5, 1].


## Random Forest Classifer (RF) solution
